/**
 * Relationship examples
 *
 * Note: If the @Relation annotation does not meet your specific
 * use case, you might need to use the JOIN keyword in your SQL
 * queries to manually define the appropriate relationships.
 *
 * Conclusion is to create the Entity classes that you want
 * modeled as tables. There is no need to enforce relationships
 * between these classes, that will be handled when you create
 * data classes to fetch the data from the table in a format
 * that you desire. Think in objects and not in table entities.

     *      between another table (our user entity) and the first
     *      relationship data class, thus "nesting" the relationship
     *      within the new one. You will create a one to many
     *      relationship between the user entity and the
     *      PlaylistWithSongs relationship (data) class. Be sure

     *      annotation to the "parent" of the relationship
