// Lint false positive
// TODO lint is giving a false positive when a sealed class is used in DiffUtil without overriding equals function. Changed lint check from error to warning Settings -> Editor -> Inspections -> Suspicious DiffUtil Equality. Change back once IDE is updated to latest version as the bug has been fixed: http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/KT-31239
